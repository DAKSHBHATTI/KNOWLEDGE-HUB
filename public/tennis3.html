    <h1>Jannik Sinner tallies milestones with Miami Open title</h1>
    <p>Jannik Sinner’s powerful 2024 season continued as he won the Miami Open with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Grigor Dimitrov on Sunday.</p>
    <img src="assests/sinner2.jpg" alt="Jannik Sinner" />
    <p>In a flawless display, Sinner, the 2024 Australian Open champion, stretched his win-loss record this year to 22-1 in winning the Miami Open for the first time. He had been runner-up twice in 2021 and 2023 - to Hubert Hurkacz and Daniil Medvedev respectively. The Italian, who needed 73 minutes to beat Dimitrov, dropped just seven games combined in the semifinals and finals.</p>
    <p>“I’m really proud obviously about the result,” Sinner said. “I started off struggling a little bit this week. I haven’t had so much time to adapt on this court, so I knew in the beginning that it’s going to be tough. As the tournament went on, I felt better and better. Today’s performance was really, really good. I’m just proud how I handled the situation. It was not easy, so it was a very, very good two weeks.”</p>
