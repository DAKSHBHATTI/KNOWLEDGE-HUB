    <h1>Mustafizur set to miss SRH clash to process US Visa</h1>
    <p>Mustafizur Rahman, the Bangladesh pacer, is likely to miss the next game for Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2024 as he has flown to Bangladesh to process his US Visa ahead of the T20 World Cup 2024 which will be held in the Caribbean and the United States from June.</p>
    <img src="assests/fiz.jpg" alt="mustafizur" />
    <p ID="TOP">The pacer won't be available for CSK's next match - an away encounter against Sunrisers Hyderabad on April 5 - and is expected to return on Sunday or Monday, depending on when he gets his passport back. A Monday (April 8) return would be cutting it close and could even force him to miss the home match against Kolkata Knight Riders which will be played on the same day.</p>
    <p>Mustafizur has played a pivotal role for CSK so far in the tournament, having bagged seven wickets in three matches to be atop the bowling leaderboard. He registered match-winning figures of 4-29 in the opening game of IPL 2024 between CSK and Royal Challengers Bangalore. He followed up with 2-30 in the game against Gujarat Titans, again in a winning cause. He was, however, expensive in the game against Delhi Capitals, his former IPL franchise, as he conceded 47 runs from his four overs for one wicket.</p>
    <p>Mustafizur will be available to play in the IPL only till the end of April, with the left-arm seamer slated to join the national side ahead of their five-match T20I series against Zimbabwe which starts on May 3. "His NOC for the tournament runs till April 30 and we are expecting him to back after that from IPL," Yunus added.</P>
