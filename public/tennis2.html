    <h1>The "turducken" of tennis? Jon Wertheim hails Alcaraz, Sinner and Medvedev as the next Big 3</h1>
    <p ID="TOP">On the latest Served with Andy Roddick, the conversation kicks off with a take on the next wave of ATP tennis stars. Weekly guest on the show and esteemed tennis journalist Jon Wertheim added his own take on the matter.</p>

    <p>“I was going with the turducken metaphor,” he said. “I don't know who's the chicken, turkey, or duck among Sinner, Alcaraz and Medvedev, choose your own, but these are three guys who have kind of distanced themselves from the pack here and ironically enough not one of them is ranked No. 1.”</p>
    <p>Djokovic has held the No. 1 ranking for 418 weeks, twice as many weeks at No.1 than any other active player, including Rafael Nadal. However, his 2024 season has been met with some unexpected results. Not only was Djokovic defeated at the Australian Open earlier this year by eventual champion Jannik Sinner—a tournament that more often than not sets the Serbian up for a successful tennis year—but he also had a shocking third-round loss to lucky loser Luca Nardi at Indian Wells.</p>
