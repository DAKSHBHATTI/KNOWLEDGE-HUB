    <h1>Bracewell is set to make debut as a captain for new zealand in upcoming t20 series with pakistan</h1>
<P> New Zealand Cricket has announced Michael Bracewell</P>
<p>Michael Bracewell will lead New Zealand for the first time as the selectors announced a 15-member squad for the upcoming five-match T20I series against Pakistan.</p>

    <p ID="TOP">New Zealand, meanwhile, will be without several of their frontline players who are either unavailable due to their stints in the IPL or for other reasons. Trent Boult, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitch Santner and Kane Williamson are all part of different teams in the IPL. Will Young (winter contract with Nottinghamshire), Tom Latham (awaiting birth of second child) and Tim Southee (conditioning) and Colin Munro were also unavailable for selection.</p>
    <p>Bracewell will be making his first international appearance since March 2023 as a ruptured Achilles and then a broken finger kept him out of action. The 33-year old all-rounder was back playing active cricket during the Plunket Shield where he picked up a first-class career-best of 8 for 41 in his first match upon return..</p>
    <p>"Michael has faced a long period on the sideline and it's exciting to see him back playing cricket again," said New Zealand selector Sam Wells. "The fact he's back playing at a high level after an Achilles rupture is testament to his hard work and application. He's a well-respected leader and has captaincy experience for Wellington along with New Zealand A and New Zealand XI teams, which we believe holds him in good stead to lead the group in Pakistan</p>
