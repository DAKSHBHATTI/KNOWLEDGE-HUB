    <h1>Hasaranga's SRH stint in IPL 2024 still uncertain</h1>
    <p>The Wanindu Hasaranga issue is becoming increasingly complex with no confirmation from the player regarding his arrival in Hyderabad. The franchise is uncertain whether to seek a replacement or wait longer. The whole issue has left them in a state of limbo.</p>
    <img src="hasaranga.jpg" alt="hasaranga" />
    <p ID="TOP"></p>
    <p>It has been noted that despite claiming an injury to his left ankle, which reportedly prevents his participation in the IPL, Hasaranga was selected by the SLC in its Test team, which was having its matches in Bangladesh parallel to the IPL.</p>
     <p>The ICC has declined to comment on the matter. However, the challenges before the world body are evident. Firstly, any cricketer can return to play in any format according to ICC regulations. Secondly, boards have the autonomy to select players for different formats. Thirdly, the player himself played the limited overs games preceding the Bangladesh Tests, which presumably means he was fit and the SLC has stated in the media that he was in their Test plans.</p>
     <p>he BCCI and the SRH franchise have refrained from commenting on the matter but it is very much likely that the trend of some foreign players staying away from the league due to low auction returns will be taken up at the owners meeting the BCCI has called on Ahmedabad on April 16. It has happened a few times in the past. For the record, Hasaranga auction value came down from Rs 10.75 crore (by RCB in 2022) to the base price of Rs 1.5 crore in the 2023 auction.</p>
