    <h1>Hardik booed at Wankhede; Manjrekar asks crowd to 'behave'</h1>
    <p>Hardik Pandya's maiden entry to the Wankhede Stadium as the captain of Mumbai Indians wasn't as pleasant as it should have been. The home crowd booed their skipper and cheered for 'Rohit Sharma' at the toss. The cheers and chanting for the former captain were audible many hours before the match started when the fans had queued outside the stadium.</p>
    <img src="hardik.jpg" alt="HARDIK PANDYA" />
    <p ID="TOP">It wasn't just Rohit Sharma who was dismissed for a golden duck. Naman Dhir followed him back to the pavilion soon enough. Also for a first-ball duck. Also dismissed by Trent Boult - the former MI pacer. And then, it was Dewald Brevis's turn to join the group. This is only the sixth time in IPL when three of the top four batters have scored ducks in an innings. What more, all falling off the first ball. To put into perspective the early threat of Boult, he has now taken 25 wickets in the first over of an innings in IPL since 2020 - no other bowler has taken more than eight.</p>
    <p>At the toss on Monday, Sanjay Manjrekar was taken aback by the boos of the crowd towards Hardik and impulsively told them to 'behave'. To the disappointment of the Mumbai crowd though, Rohit Sharma was dismissed for a first-ball duck, only the fifth time in the IPL.</p>
    <p>The fan wars have taken an ugly turn since the change in MI's captaincy, so much so that a few days ago it forced R Ashwin to request the fans to not make a big deal about the change in captaincy and respect Pandya as a fellow Indian cricketer.</p>
