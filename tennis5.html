    <h1>Tennis News: Simona Halep's setback and Dominic Thiem's new injury</h1>
    <p>Halep's return cut short for now; Thiem plans to play. Just when the tennis world thought it might be getting Simona Halep back, she is out again.</p>
    <img src="simona.jpg" alt="Tennis Update">
    <p>The announcement was made by the Romanian Tennis Federation. Exactly what the medical issue might be is unknown. Halep, after over a year's long absence from tennis due to a suspension for testing positive for the banned substance Roxadustat, made her return to tennis at the Miami Open. She won the first set of her opening match against Paula Badosa, but then lost the last two so ultimately, her return was not successful.</p>
    <p>After such a long lay-off, coming back to almost immediately play high-end competitive tennis can be difficult. Halep was likely in a rush to return since she felt as if she was wrongfully suspended, and she is 32 years old so she probably does not have years left to play. Still, one might logically wonder if she came back too fast.</p>
    <h2>Simona Halep suffers a setback while Dominic Thiem plans to play</h2>
    <p>As there is no timetable for her return currently, it is unknown if she will be ready for the French Open in May. She won the major in 2018 and is a very good clay-court player. Perhaps she will only be out for a couple of weeks and then will return to her competitive ways by May.</p>
