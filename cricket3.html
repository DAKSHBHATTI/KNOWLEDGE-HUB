    <h1>Stokes pulls out of T20 World Cup to focus on fitness</h1>
    <p>Ben Stokes has pulled out of the upcoming T20 World Cup in the West Indies and USA in order to focus on his fitness. Stokes, who hit an unbeaten fifty in the final of the previous edition in Australia to guide England to the title, has revealed that he intends to regain full fitness in order to bowl again, and asked the ECB not to consider him for selection.</p>

    <p ID="TOP">Stokes struggled with a knee injury last year and didn't bowl in the final three Ashes Tests against Australia at home. Having previously announced his ODI retirement, he made himself available to play the World Cup in India but featured in the tournament as a pure batter. Eventually, the 32-year-old underwent surgery after the completion of the tournament and was racing against time to make it to the Test series in India.</p>
    <p>While he did start bowling in the nets slowly at some point during the series, Stokes bowled only in the final Test match in Dharamsala. Stokes has now eyed the County Championship to return as an allrounder so that he can bowl during England's home summer against West Indies and Sri Lanka.</p>
    <p>"I'm working hard and focusing on building my bowling fitness back up to fulfil a full role as an all-rounder in all formats of cricket," Stokes said. "Opting out of the IPL and the World Cup will hopefully be a sacrifice that allows me to be the all-rounder I want to be for the foreseeable future.</p>
